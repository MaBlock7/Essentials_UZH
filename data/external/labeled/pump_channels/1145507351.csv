0,29,2017-07-02 07:44:32+00:00,1145507351,"🚨 Schedule for Sunday 2nd July 🚨 🕒 Time : 15:00 GMT | 11:00 EDT | 23:00 CST 🕒 Group : LINK TO TELEGRAM GROUP: t Notes : Explained further in the last post . Try and get in when the coins are announced and set your sell orders before the pump is announced at 15:00 . 🕒 Time : 15:00 GMT | 11:00 EDT | 23:00 CST 🕒 Group : LINK TO TELEGRAM GROUP: t Notes : I believe a minimum of 3 separate groups are providing the same coin at the same time ; collectively they have ~ 4,200 . I think the first to post is via LINK TO TELEGRAM GROUP: t , but also involved are LINK TO TELEGRAM GROUP: t & LINK TO TELEGRAM GROUP: t . When they pumped yesterday , the spread between the group lead to the 24hr high being set in the 4th minute of the pump . I would not advice participating in this pump until I confirm which is the lead group , but it could be worth watching . 🕒 Time : 17:00 GMT | 13:00 EDT | 01:00 CST 🕒 Group : LINK TO TELEGRAM GROUP: t Notes : Now currently at 17,267 members . No special approach here , just hope that 17,266 people are slower than you . Keep an eye on the sample link that is supplied 1 hour before the pump - is usually gains 10 - 30 % ."

0,19,2017-06-30 10:08:42+00:00,1145507351,"🚨 Pump schedule for 30th June 🚨 🕒 Time : 15:00 GMT | 11:00 EDT | 00:00 CST 🕒 Group : LINK TO TELEGRAM GROUP: t Notes : Yesterday's pump was on a coin that had already been pumped TWICE by 2 other groups in the same day . Unsurprisingly , it faced large resistance due to high sell orders from the other pumps and reached a high of 91.54 % from the pre-pump before a sharp decent . I'm hoping to see a better choice of coin from this group today . My original advice applies again , be conservative with investing on the pump and monitor the dip after . When this group dumps , it dumps hard . 🕒 Time : 16:00 GMT | 12:00 EDT | 01:00 CST 🕒 Group : LINK TO TELEGRAM GROUP: t Notes : With now close to 17,000 members , on paper you should be excited about this pump . I'm sure it'll be another 1000 % + increase with an appearance on the bittrex_CEX homepage . My concern is will you actually see any of it ? I'm going to try and break the analysis of this pump into second by second , rather than minute by minute to give us all a much clearer picture . With the influx of volume , the pump can produce opportunities to ping pong off the volatility for the hours after , but I fear you'll mainly be fighting bots in this pump . 🕒 Time : 17:00 GMT | 13:00 EDT | 02:00 CST 🕒 Group : LINK TO TELEGRAM GROUP: t Notes : As I mentioned yesterday , the pump had lower volume but a longer period before the price dropped . This has been a consistent pattern , so i'd expect more of the same ; consider this pump the polar opposite of PumpNotifier . Buying in ~ 40 % on top of the prepump price could give around 5 - 10 minutes before you'd be selling at a loss based on the previous pumps . Full analysis from yesterday is on its way shortly ."

3,16,2017-06-29 18:43:15+00:00,1145507351,"Hi all , Here are the results from one of the scheduled pumps 🕔 Pumped 17:00 GMT 🕔 ▶ ️Group : LINK TO TELEGRAM GROUP: t ▶ ️Results : The pre-pump price on BTA was 0.0002757 0 . After the pump started , it reached a high of 0.0004469 0 which represented a 62.1 % increase . The pump continued into the second minute where a new high was reached ( 0.0004500 0 ) . 23 minutes later , the price consolidated at a new low of 0.0002351 0 before the price began to rise again . ▶ ️Conclusion : As I mentioned in the schedule , you had longer to hold but with a relatively low price increase . It's promising to see the price continuing to rise well into the second minute . Either members are more willing to hold and not selling straight away , and / or the group isn't plagued by bots shorting the pump . I'd recommend keeping an eye on their next pump tomorrow to see if the volume of trade increases to improve the percentage gain . ✅ Was this information useful ?

My investment would go here as the price rally's up shortly after ; we've seen this pattern 2/3 times from this group . 🕔 Time : 17:00 GMT 🕔 Group : LINK TO TELEGRAM GROUP: t Notes : I would suggest placing a very low trial investment on this group to see how it plays out . The last pump had a relatively low price increase , however you had longer to hold your money before placing a sell order . I'll probably do an analysis on this one in the near future if the pump holds . 🕗 Time : 20:00 GMT 🕗 Group : LINK TO TELEGRAM GROUP: t Notes : with 2 fantastic pumps to their name , I've been looking forward to see if the trend continues . So far we have seen a steady increase roughly 3 hours after the initial pumps ( view my analysis from earlier today regarding their last pump ) . My suggested approach is to see what price you get in at . If it's already high , invest on the rebound of the dump around 3 hours later and keep an eye on the trajectory . The group is a good size and hopefully the pumps will not collapse due to inflated numbers like we've seen in other pump groups . This is my pick of the day . ✅ Please help spread the channel to keep it active - LINK TO TELEGRAM GROUP: t"

LINK TO TELEGRAM GROUP: t . 20:45 BST ( GMT + 1 ) 🚨 The group tried switching over to a website to present the pick , however it crashed and they are now performing a second pump this evening via telegram . The viewed message count has dropped from around 2.3 k before the last pump , to now around 500 - 1.1 k . Because of this , it could be assumed of a lower volume pump . My advice would be to get in quick at a + 1 % on the ask price , and sell within the minute . If you can't get in quick , sit this one out ."
