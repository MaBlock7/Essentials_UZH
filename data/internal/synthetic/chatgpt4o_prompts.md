#### Pump Announcement
Create synthetic data. Create telegram channel messages in crypto pump-and-dump channels. The messages will follow this prompt: "Pump Announcement - Formal Announcement of a new pump; has to include the date, time and the name of the exchange." These messages are usually clearly labelled as announcements and catch the telegram users' attention by using a mixture of capitalised words, non-capitalised words, emojis and over-the-top wording. The emojis are humanly placed and not always symmetrically placed on both sides of the announcement message. In general, the messages sound and look rather human and are not simply lists or bullet points, although they might incorporate such elements as well. They differ in the way they look quite significantly, so make each message a bit different from the others, they should all be unique. No real crypto exchange names shall be used, invent fake ones that sound like they could be real. Create 500 such synthetic messages and return them in a csv file with column 1 name "label" having 0 for all rows and column 2 name "message" having the messages. Therefore, make sure that each messages is on only one single line, so newline characters must be removed.

#### Target Coin
Create synthetic data. Create telegram channel messages in crypto pump-and-dump channels. The messages will follow this prompt: "Target Coin Announcement - Reveals the token symbol to buy, usually brief, sometimes only the token symbol." These messages are usually short and concise, consisting either only of the coin name or an additional few filler words such as "the coin is:" or "today's pump is:". Usually, though, the message only consists of the coin name. The coin name is always in all caps. Also, these messages aren't meant to generate hype, they only serve an informative purpose. In general, the messages sound and look rather human. They differ in the way they look quite significantly, so make each message a bit different from the others, they should all be unique. No real crypto coin names shall be used, invent fake ones that sound like they could be real. Create 500 such synthetic messages and return them in a csv file with column 1 name "label" having 2 for all rows and column 2 name "message" having the messages. Therefore, make sure that each messages is on only one single line, so newline characters must be removed.

#### Post Analysis
Create synthetic data. Create telegram channel messages in crypto pump-and-dump channels. The messages will follow this prompt: "Shows the resulting profits from the pump or provides an overview of previous pumps by mentioning the previous token symbols and profits." These messages sound very positive and proud in most cases, praising the channel members in a celebratory way on the pump performance (pump height, volume and time) in an almost over-the-top manner. Rarely, the messages are negative, scolding the members and motivating them to pump the coin higher and for longer in the next pump. In general, the messages sound and look rather human, so also randomise emoji placement. They differ in the way they look quite significantly, so make each message a bit different from the others, they should all be unique. No real crypto coin names shall be used, invent fake ones that sound like they could be real. However, most messages don't contain the name of the pumped coin anyway. Create 500 such synthetic messages and return them in a csv file with column 1 name "label" having 3 for all rows and column 2 name "message" having the messages. Therefore, make sure that each messages is on only one single line, so newline characters must be removed.

#### Cancellation / Postponement
Create synthetic data. Create telegram channel messages in crypto pump-and-dump channels. The messages will follow this prompt: "Announcement that the pump is cancelled, postponed, or delayed for any reason." These messages usually sound apologetic towards the members, explaining that for some reason the pump cannot go ahead. Sometimes, the specific reason is stated. Often, they use the words "fail, delay, postpone, cancel" or variations thereof, not always though. In general, the messages sound and look rather human, so also randomise emoji placement, if any. They differ in the way they look quite significantly, so make each message a bit different from the others, they should all be unique. No coin names shall be used whatsoever, since this is before the pump and the coin name is unknown. Create 500 such synthetic messages and return them in a csv file with column 1 name "label" having 3 for all rows and column 2 name "message" having the messages. Therefore, make sure that each messages is on only one single line, so newline characters must be removed.

### Anomalous Cancellation / Postponement

#### 1st Stage:
We are investigating pump and dump schemes on telegram. Our interest lies in classifying messages common in a pump and dump scheme, such as the pump announcement, countdown messages, target coin releases and post pump summaries. At times, the organisers release cancellation/postponement messages which are rare and thus we want to upsample them.

Typical messages look like this:
"Todays Pump is postponed We absolutely do not like to do this , its costs us time , energy , and all of you potential profit . But in the end it also saves us all from a potentially unsafe trades . We chose the best coin , set up our automatic posting / buying tools and at the last minute there were too many weird buys on the selected coin . "" Pump Hunters "" try to guess our coin always , some even buy a random coin just before the pump so spike bots buy after them . We believe this is what happened today , and it happened too late for us to redo the work in time to have a different coin posted before 17:00 GMT . To make sure everything is safe we are postponing this pump . A new date will be announced soon . Thank you all for understanding"

To enhance the robustness of our classifier can you come up with a selection of crypto concepts similar to pump and dump schemes that might get postponed/cancelled such as airdrops, token releases, ICOs, etc?

#### 2nd Stage:
Generate 10 messages for each category Airdrops, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), Token Sales/Token Releases, Coin Listings and NFT Drops. Vary the vocabulary, use token symbols that sound fishy like MOON, PND Coin, BABYDOGE, etc, use emojis but don't overdo it, blame information leakage, technical problems, etc. And release them in a .csv file, add headers "label" and "message" and for each message add the label 5.

Example messages are as follows
(1) Pump is cancelled ... as yobit_CEX ... is not responding properly ... So we will do tomorrow ... We want to make sure ... u should buy low level n make sure profit ...
(2) "Todays Pump needs to be postponed . Unexplained volume was added to our pick . Therefore to protect everyone we will reschedule . We dont want added sell pressure during a pump , we need to have full control of the coin , not the outsiders . Other groups may have ignored this for reasons of greed but we will always put members above all else and never willing conduct a risky pump . @USER ⭐ ️"
