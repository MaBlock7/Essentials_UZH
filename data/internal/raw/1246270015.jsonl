Fortunately for us we trade in the USDT market, these markets have more activity today than ever before. More USDT and more activity means more traders ready to buy our coin today as we make it a green gem in this sea of red. Our coin will easily become the top gainer of the day and gain a lot of attention. We expect the most volume ever in our pump and by far the most volume from outside traders. We will all be able to buy the target coin from a low price as we send it extraordinarily high. These factors mean our coin will likely hold its inflated value for much longer than normal. We hope you are ready for a great pump today because it will be one of our best yet!", "views": 289, "image": null}

When you buy the coin do not buy 100% market directly in the first minute. Instead buy try buying with 50/75% of your balance and later use the rest for rebuying the dip. The aim is to buy and rebuy slowly for continued growth. We advise to not invest more than 75% of your capital in the first minute.\n2. After you have invested the first part of your funds start promoting the coin everywhere on social media. We will send you 2-5 post which you can directly copy/paste about good charting and info to buy the coin.\n3. Our principal mission is to push the coin and sell to binance outsiders over 100%. NEVER PANIC SELL! If the coin drops in short time you don't need to be scarred its not the moment to sell but rebuy the dip and push to a new higher. This time we are sure that we will push to 100% with the combined power of everyone. Do not look to sell quickly, look to sell for max gains over the course of the push, this could be up to an hour or more.\n\n- The advantages during the Push:\n\n1. Push bot will market buy $100-2500 every 1-5 seconds to raise the price and create more FOMO.\n2. My bot will market buy $1-2 every second which will also help create FOMO also.\n3. When the coin submits a crash we will put big limits in the dip and start buying more to repost higher, so when you see big walls buy during a dip this is the moment to rebuy.\n4. Members of the best pump/push groups will also be joining us to increase our power even further. This is gong to be a huge deal, all of binance will take notice.\n\nThings you need in order to join:\n1) A binance.com account loaded with bitcoin\n2) To watch this channel 24 hours from now\n3) Buy the target coin asap after the announcement and follow along closely for rebuying and selling.\n4) Help promote the coin news", "views": 274, "image": null}

Some Wall Street firms have been buying Bitcoin since late summer since they had inside info that CBOE and CME would self certify and launch Bitcoin futures trading at the end of 2017. The firms that bought up BTC in late summer and early fall were one of the main price drivers during that time. Their heavy buying drove the price very high, very fast. \n\nAt the same time they started having their connections at mainstream finanical media outlets commentate on the breathless rise of Bitcoin, thus inducing FOMO in the average mom and pop retail investor who only owns some stock in a shoddy 401k. These retail investors were designated as the bag holders. Futures launched and after a brief delay of a few trading days all the other trading platorms joined and allowed participants to sell futures contracts short. However, they only allowed short selling with 5x the margin of going long on the same contract. Ostensibly to cover their ass as the futures trading clearing house and in the case of shorting anything you loss potential is unlimited. But there is another reason they did this, huge margin requirements mean that only the biggest whales can go short Bitcoin futures. And those are the very Wall Street firms that pumped the price these last few months. \n\nAfter they went short on Bitcoin futures and volume in the spot market was still brisk and price was high, they began to sell the Bitcoin for big profit. Eventually the heavy selling caused the price to begin to tumble. Then the first round of weak hands, those who bought BTC at peak with debt, paniced and sold. Then the next set and the next set of weak hands. All the while Wall Street firms are selling BTC at still heafty profits and their short contracts become more in profit by the day. The first futures contracts expire on January 19th (CBOE) and January 26th (CME).\n\nI'm not sure what will happen between now and then, but near those contract end dates I expect the price to be depressed like it is now.", "views": 240, "image": null}
